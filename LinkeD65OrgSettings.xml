  <orgSetting name="AutoCreateContactOnPromote"
              description="&lt;p&gt;By default, when a user sets regarding within the Outlook app, if any email address is in the To / CC / BCC etc that D365 does not know about, it creates it automatically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the time this is fine, but consider when your business process requires a lot more data fields to be populated in the contact, this default process will create a contact that hasn’t got what your business needs. Forcing the contact creation away from this automation may be required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users have an option under their personal settings which will mimic this settings, but this does it for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;"

          description="&lt;p&gt;In 2019 Wave 2, October 2019, enhancements were made to the timeline, to improve the density of activities and allowing the user to filter by multiple types etc. Details &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2019wave2/dynamics365-customer-service/timeline-usability-enhancements&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
          The new timeline can be seen below, which is toggled with EnableActivitiesFeatures described below. This setting toggles improvements to the performance of the new timeline, which may have an impact on your application..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
          Thought the official line is that this is disabled by default, in any new environment it seems to be enabled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
