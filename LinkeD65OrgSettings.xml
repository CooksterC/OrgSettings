  <orgSetting name="AutoCreateContactOnPromote" description="&lt;p&gt;By default, when a user sets regarding within the Outlook app, if any email address is in the To / CC / BCC etc that D365 does not know about, it creates it automatically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the time this is fine, but consider when your business process requires a lot more data fields to be populated in the contact, this default process will create a contact that hasn’t got what your business needs. Forcing the contact creation away from this automation may be required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users have an option under their personal settings which will mimic this settings, but this does it for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;" url="https://linked365.blog/2019/10/01/d365-org-db-settings-email/#TrackAppointmentsFromNonOrganizer"> </orgSetting>
