This tool is for use in [XrmToolBox](https://www.xrmtoolbox.com/) and borrows heavily from [Sean McNellis](https://github.com/seanmcne/OrgDbOrgSettings/) original tool, particularly it has a link to read his XML file on load of the application.

Please use the XrmToolBox tool to get the latest version.

**Please only change a value if you have a good reason to do so. _No warranty for any corruption is accepted_**
